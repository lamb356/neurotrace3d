# NeuroTrace3D Feature Roadmap

## Status Key
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Done

## Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)
- [x] 1. PNG screenshot export
- [x] 2. Basic stats panel (total length, branch points, tips, depth, per-type counts)
- [x] 3. Dark/light mode toggle

## Medium (1-2 hours each)
- [x] 4. Measurement tools (distance between nodes, branch angle)
- [x] 5. Sholl analysis (concentric spheres, intersection chart, CSV export)
- [x] 6. Validation warnings panel (clickable, flies camera to problem node)
- [x] 7. Box selection tool (drag rectangle, frustum select)
- [x] 8. Path selection tool (click two nodes, select path between)
- [ ] 9. Branch split
- [ ] 10. Branch prune (recursive delete subtree)
- [ ] 11. Branch extend (click to add nodes sequentially)

## Harder (2-4 hours each)
- [ ] 12. Branch merge
- [ ] 13. Orthogonal 2D view panels (XY, XZ, YZ)
- [ ] 14. Keyboard shortcuts system

## Heavy (half-day+ each)
- [ ] 15. Loro CRDT collaborative editing
- [ ] 16. User accounts + project management
- [ ] 17. Documentation site

## AI Integration (save for last)
- [ ] 18. ITK-WASM microscopy loading
- [ ] 19. Image-SWC overlay rendering
- [ ] 20. MicroSAM hybrid pipeline (server encoder, client decoder)
- [ ] 21. Gemini integration + AI suggestions panel
